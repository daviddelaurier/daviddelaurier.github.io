<h2>Machine Learning Engineer</h2>
<p>I am a Machine Learning Engineer who is always pushing the current limits of ML models, allowing me to stay a step ahead and develop innovative solutions for difficult problems. I am very experienced in the entire ML pipeline, from data collection and dataset creation to model training, deployment, and full-stack development. I love what I do and would like to discuss what I can offer and bring value to the team.</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<h3>Lumisync (AI/ML software branch of Redefined Lighting)</h3>

ETL Pipeline complex PDF specification sheets. Search Engine (hybrid) development for the light fixture manufacturing industry as an internal tool to search across all lightfixtures globally.</p>
<h4>Senior Machine Learning Engineer</h4>
<p>Full-time</p>
<ul>
    <li>Designed and built our in-house Document AI pipeline. - Fully autonomous - Inputs: text, audio, video - Processes and Parses required datapoints, formatted to spec - Outputs: Indexed to database</li>
    <li>Designed and Annotated a 100k parameter training datasets for open source LLMs, deployed to production.</li>
    <li>Performed iterative fine-tuning and model training using Vertex AI on GCP, achieving 97.2% F1 score for our use case. Increased from 73% (base model). Utilized Hugging Face's open source models and training platform for on-prem deployments.</li>
    <li>Deployed trained models using Google Cloud AI Platform and Vertex AI.</li>
    <li>Built Hybrid Search (Semantic & Keyword) Platform using Relational, Vector, and Graph databases connected to ElasticSearch.</li>
</ul>

<h3>pdf2search.com</h3>
<p>03/2019 - Present<br>
We process and extract unstructured data into structured output formats. All types of documents, including scanned and handwritten. Custom-built search engines and RAG pipelines. Custom trained client chatbots for internal and external deployment.</p>
<h4>Founder</h4>
<p>Board</p>
<ul>
    <li>Developed and Deployed a fully automated document ingestion and fully searchable database for The Commonwealth of the Bahamas, Registrar General. Extracted and Indexed all physical documents dating from 1929 to present day. 600k scanned documents, ~7 million pages. Used for the Title Insurance underwriting and Chain-of-Ownership for the Mortgage Lending division of The Royal Bank of Canada</li>
    <li>Developed and trained our text detection model, db_resnet50, and text recognition model, crnn_vgg16_bn. Maintained cross compatibility with Tensorflow/PyTorch. F1 score from 95.7% to 98.9%.</li>
    <li>Developed and built our solution to process handwritten and typewritten documents, I trained Microsoft's TrOCR base model on domain specific datasets, enabling us to process fully handwritten and damaged documents dating back to 1929.</li>
    <li>Built custom PostgreSQL and Neo4j databases for clients. Embedded and Indexed into ElasticSearch, allowing full semantic and keyword search with intelligent ReRank. Can be used for search or RAG depending on client use case.</li>
    <li>Built custom ElasticSearch UI's as well as company chatbots (RAG), unique to each clients specifications and requirements.</li>
    <li>Developed document extraction techniques with validation checks, ensuring data integrity is maintained throughout the ETL pipeline. Current structured output formats are .txt, .xml, .json, and .csv</li>
    <li>Custom fine-tuning of open source Instruct and Chat LLMs. Some models include: Mistral-7b, Mixtral-8x7b, Llama-2, and many others. I test almost every new model when they are released.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Redactable.com</h3>  
<p>11/2023 - 02/2024<br>
AI enhanced online document redaction.</p>
<h4>Senior Machine Learning Engineer</h4>
<p>Part-time</p>
<ul>
    <li>Led the development of a text detection and recognition training dataset. OCR model accuracy improved from 86.7% to 97.1%, significantly enhancing operational efficiency and accuracy.</li>
    <li>Built and deployed Conversational AI Agents. The agent framework automated NER, PII detection, as well as provided suggestions for your document depending on the context and user requirements. Multiple fine-tuned versions of Mixtral-8X7B, each trained on subtasks, allowed for extremely good results, catching text that needed to be redacted that the user missed.</li>
    <li>Designed and managed a secure PostgreSQL database for temporary storage of redacted documents and metadata.</li>
</ul>
